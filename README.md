Simple Instant Message Broadcasting Service

A very naive implemented messaging service. The client uses ncurses to render a simple chat window.
You can quit the client by typing a | (pipe) (since I wasn't able to make keypad mode with Function Keys F1-F12 work).
You can tell the server to change your username by sending a message /n [Username].
